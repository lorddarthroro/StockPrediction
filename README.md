The Java file is a parser that I used to produce a cleaner, more easy to use CSV file using information from the 5Year file. It stores that clean data in the "clean data file", which  I used as the data set for the python file.

This is just a for-fun project to get some extra comfort with using python for machine learning. My model isn't too accurate, seems to be hovering around 75%, and it largely leans towards "buy", probably overfitting. I need to spend time adding more data to try to make it more accurate.
